# b16-lab-code
A simulation of a spring-mass system with any number of masses and springs in the desired configurations.

This implementation uses freeglut to create an animation of the system in 2D, using the class Figure2D, and in 3D using Figure3D.
The 2D figure includes a grid for reference.
The 3D figure allows you to change the perspective using the arrow keys to rotate around the structure and using Q and E to move closer or further away.

In order to run the simulation just run the executable in terminal providing a text file containing the data as argument.
See File_Format.txt and tetrahedra.txt for an example on how to write the text file.
