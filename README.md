# b16-lab-code
A simulation of a spring-mass system with any number of masses and springs in the desired configurations.

My implementation uses freeglut to create an animation of the system in 2D, using the class Figure2D, and in 3D using Figure3D.
The 2D figure includes a grid for reference.
The 3D figure allows you to change the perspective using the arrow keys to rotate around the structure and using Q and E to move closer or further away.
